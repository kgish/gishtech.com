        <h4>Dependable and down-to-earth</h4>
        <p>
            I provide professional consultancy on advanced software development, methodologies, tooling, people and
            processes for web-based applications.
        </p>

        <h4>From start to finish non-stop</h4>
        <p>
            I do full stack frontend and backend development for the complete software development life cycle: user
            stories, testing, implementation, testing, deployment, testing, all the way through after-care and
            maintenance.
        </p>

        <h4>Team management and the fun factor</h4>
        <p>
            I take coaching and motivating teams seriously, encouraging a sense of fun in order to build
            stuff that we can be proud about.
        </p>

        <h4>Straight-forward and pragmatic work ethos</h4>
        <p>
            I believe in a hands-on roll up your sleeves attitude where getting the job done right the very first time
            is the name of the game.
