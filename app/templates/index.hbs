        <h4>Looking for a dependable and down-to-earth professional?</h4>
        <p>
            I provide best-of-breed services and advice on advanced software development, methodologies, tooling, people and
            processes for web-based applications.
        </p>

        <h4>From start to finish non-stop</h4>
        <p>
            I do full stack front- and backend development over the complete software development life cycle: from user stories, testing,
            implementation, testing, deployment, testing all the way through after-care and maintenance.
        </p>

        <h4>Team management and the fun factor</h4>
        <p>
            I take coaching and motivating teams seriously, fostering a sense of fun in order to build
            stuff that they can be proud of.
        </p>

        <h4>Straight-forward and pragmatic work ethos</h4>
        <p>
            I believe in a hands-on roll up your sleeves attitude where getting the job done right the very first time
            is the name of the game.
