        <h4 class="with-fa">{{fa-icon 'plus-square' class='text-success'}}&nbsp; Dependable and down-to-earth</h4>
        <p>
            I provide professional consultancy on advanced software development, methodologies, tooling, people and
            processes for web-based applications.
        </p>

        <h4 class="with-fa">{{fa-icon 'plus-square' class='text-success'}}&nbsp; From start to finish non-stop</h4>
        <p>
            I do full stack development over the complete software development life cycle: user stories, testing,
            implementation, testing, deployment, testing, all the way through after-care, maintenance and testing.
        </p>

        <h4 class="with-fa">{{fa-icon 'plus-square' class='text-success'}}&nbsp; Team management is fun</h4>
        <p>
            I take coaching and motivating teams seriously, fostering the fun-factor and encouraging others to build
            stuff that we can be proud about.
        </p>

        <h4 class="with-fa">{{fa-icon 'plus-square' class='text-success'}}&nbsp; Straight-forward work ethos</h4>
        <p>
            I am pragmatic and believe in a hands-on mentality where rolling up your sleeves and getting the job done
            right the very first time is the name of the game.
        </p>

        <h4 class="with-fa">{{fa-icon 'plus-square' class='text-success'}}&nbsp; Lots and lots of testing</h4>
        <p>
            I am a real stickler when it comes to testing, and where possible I introduce automated testing as early as
            possible in order to avoid introducing unnecessary bugs.
