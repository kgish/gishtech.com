        <h4>Simple and symbolic logo</h4>
        <p>
            This is the new logo that I designed myself. I used SVG and a little dab of creativity. The three colors
            are: midnight blue, dark cyan and firebrick. They blend in together quite nicely. The interlocking shapes
            are shifted slightly downwards from left to right. This gives a slight impression that each shape rises a
            little above the previous one.

            Each geometrical piece of the puzzle integrates snugly with the next one. Together the three objects form
            a unified and pleasing whole. These shapes represent the software building blocks that I like to use when
            creating beautiful objects.
