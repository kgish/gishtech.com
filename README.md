## Introduction

I decided to make this website public and share it on my github. That way other people who might be interested in 
creating a similar website using the amazing [Ember.js framework](http://emberjs.com) can see for themselves how I 
did it. This is just a simple website advertising myself as an enthusiastic and eager developer looking for fun 
projects to do.

## Installation

The installation is quite straight forward.

    $ git clone https://github.com/kgish/gishtech.com.git
    $ cd gishtech.com
    $ npm install
    $ ember server
